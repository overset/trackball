# Trackball Mezzanine PCB

This is the mezzanine (daughter) PCB that connects the Adafruit QT Py (SAMD21) MCU, PMW3389 optical sensors, simple components for haptic feedback motor and pads for haptic pickup wiring. This helps create a mounting point inside the case for the components with a ground plane to help with the capacitive pickup. This simple 2-layer PCB was designed with KiCad6 and includes a few custom footprints/symbols. This can easily be printed through OSHPark, JLCPCB, etc.
